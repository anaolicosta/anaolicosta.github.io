Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) in Tom Henzingerâ€™s group. I earned my PhD at TU Wien, supervised by Ezio Bartocci.

During my PhD, I investigated the challenges of designing and verifying information-flow requirements specified as **hyperproperties** (i.e., properties specifying relations across multiple executions of a system). My current research builds on this foundation and spans three main directions: **compositional design and verification** of systems, **expressiveness of languages** for relational verification, and **runtime verification** of hyperproperties.

Iâ€™m motivated by the belief that a unified approach to the verification of hyperproperties can have a broad impact in many domains, such as computer security, concurrent and distributed systems, and  cyber-physical systems.
